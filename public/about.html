<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have completed my Engineering in EXTC in 2017.<br />
  I started preparing for Govt.exams and that is how i landed up in a banking job.<br />
  At some age we realise that we should be doing what we love and hence started my journey for web development.<br /> 
  I love coding and being a bit creative hence i have started to learn for web development <br />
  I am a hard-worker as well love learning new skills.
